    //     Find the largest index k such that a[k] < a[k + 1]. If no such index exists, the
    //      permutation is the last permutation.
    //     Find the largest index l greater than k such that a[k] < a[l].
    //     Swap the value of a[k] with that of a[l].
    //     Reverse the sequence from a[k + 1] up to and including the final element a[n].

    // For example, given the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4] (which is in increasing order), and given that
    // the index is zero-based, the steps are as follows:

    //     Index k = 2, because 3 is placed at an index that satisfies condition of being the
    //      largest index that is still less than a[k + 1] which is 4.
    //     Index l = 3, because 4 is the only value in the sequence that is greater than 3 in
    //      order to satisfy the condition a[k] < a[l].
    //     The values of a[2] and a[3] are swapped to form the new sequence [1, 2, 4, 3].
    //     The sequence after k-index a[2] to the final element is reversed. Because only one
    //      value lies after this index (the 3), the sequence remains unchanged in this instance.
    //      Thus the lexicographic successor of the initial state is permuted: [1, 2, 4, 3].
